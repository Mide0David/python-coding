# Number Printing Program

This program prints numbers from 0 to 99 and generates all possible different combinations of two digits.

## Program Requirements

### Task 1: Print Numbers from 0 to 99

- Numbers are separated by a comma (`,`) followed by a space.
- Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits.
- The last number is followed by a new line.
- Only no more than 2 print functions with string format are allowed.
- Only one loop is allowed in the code.
- Numbers or strings cannot be stored in variables.
- No module import is allowed.

### Task 2: Print Combinations of Two Digits

- Combinations of two digits are generated, ranging from 01 to 99.
- Numbers must be separated by a comma (`,`) followed by a space.
- The two digits in each combination must be different.
- Combinations such as "01" and "10" are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1.
- Only the smallest combination of two digits is printed.
- Combinations are printed in ascending order, with two digits.
- The last combination is followed by a new line.
- Only no more than 3 print functions with string format are allowed.
- Only no more than 2 loops are allowed in the code.
- Numbers or strings cannot be stored in variables.
- No module import is allowed.
